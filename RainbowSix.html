    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">An experimental documentary on the types of gamers you can encounter in the Rainbow Six Siege community, as well as any other team-based game. I wanted to show the good, the bad, and the weird types of people. And while I've met a lot of incredibly rude and terrible players, I've also made a lot of nice online friends along the way that I talk to frequently. I also wanted to show was how an average player of average skill level can pull off a nice play in the game, since most of the videos I see on YouTube for Rainbow Six Siege are usually a bunch of professional level strategies with very skilled players, but still make it enjoyable for viewers to watch.</p>
