    <h3 style="color: #F7F4EA">YouTube Isn't The Same</h3>
    <h3 style="color: #F7F4EA"><i>September 2017 | Glitch Art | JPG File + Audacity + Notepad</i></h3>
    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">My glitch art pertains to the problem with YouTube and its content creators, in which the latter are being constricted and confined with the content they’re allowed to post to make money off of. YouTube has been trying to convert into a family-friendly type of platform, but by doing so they also limit the freedom that creators have in their videos. It changed from a simple video sharing website to a large source of entertainment and while rules are necessary to filter out any harmful or violent videos from being seen, it’s getting to a point where they’re essentially child-proofing the site and having unnecessary censorship. With the super glitched out YouTube logo I wanted to express the idea that YouTube isn’t really YouTube anymore, it’s more like a warped version of itself which panders to a family-friendly group that the rest of the audience and its own content creators don’t even like. I did it by opening the picture’s file in a text editor and placing YouTube’s own monetization rules in different parts of the file and adding a few lines of curse words. By using its own rules against it, I managed to break and warp the image and in a way, it kind of shows that the harder YouTube tugs on the leash around the content creators, the more likely they are to rebel, protest, or leave the platform altogether, similar to how they post videos to show how upset they are with the monetization rules and how YouTube deems what is family-friendly and what isn’t.
