    <h3 style="color: #F7F4EA">YouTube Isn't The Same</h3>
    <h3 style="color: #F7F4EA"><i>September 2017 | Glitch Art | JPG File + Audacity + Notepad</i></h3>
    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">My glitch art pertains to the problem with YouTube and its content creators, in which the latter are being constricted and confined with the content they’re allowed to post to make money off of. With the super glitched out YouTube logo I wanted to express the idea that YouTube isn’t really YouTube anymore, it’s more like a warped version of itself which panders to a family-friendly group that the rest of the audience and its own content creators don’t even like. I opened the picture’s file in a text editor and placed YouTube’s own monetization rules in different parts of the file and added a few lines of curse words. By using its own rules against it, I managed to break and warp the image and in a way, it shows that the harder YouTube tugs on the leash around the content creators, the more likely they are to rebel, protest, or leave the platform altogether.
