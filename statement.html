		Artist Statement
		<br>
		<br>
		I am a multimedia artist that mainly uses video to explore the theme of an ardent desire to belong somewhere. My video art ranges from interviews where the subject will bare their heart out to short clips layered with dizzying effects that may leave the viewer feeling disoriented. I create in this way because I want the audience to feel the same emotional experience that I project in my work. I want to bridge a connection with other people so that they may be able to feel like they can find their place in the world.
		<br>
		<br>
		The art I produced during the second semester of my Junior year at SJSU was centered around this topic, more specifically about being able to figure out what a student wanted to do after college. After having several conversations with friends and classmates about how they wanted to live their life when they graduated, I was met with a lot of anxiousness and doubt because they weren’t actually sure about what to do and just thinking about the future put them on edge. Many of them were worried about putting themselves in the wrong major and being too late to change while others didn’t know what kind of job they wanted to get into when all they know how to do is produce art. Based on this, I created a documentary where my friends discussed their feelings about this subject in an open, non-filtered way. They were able to talk about their uncertainties without feeling like they were judged. I wanted to use this video as a way for other students to realize that they aren’t alone in their struggles and to feel a sense of community and connectedness.
		<br>
		<br>
		My process for creating art usually starts with an issue that I am struggling with and I try to imagine what kind of video would represent that. I think about whether it should be a literal representation or a figurative one through different effects. I then scriptwrite if there’s dialogue involved or have a list of specific shots I want to get. A lot of this process is improvised and figuring out while shooting, however. The candid factor can make the video more engaging than something that was scripted.</div>
