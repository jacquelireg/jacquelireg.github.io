    <h3 style="color: #F7F4EA">ABOUT THE ARTIST</h3>
    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">I am a digital media artist and works mainly with video art. In this modern day where internet and technology is a major part of people's lives, I like to explore the pop culture aspect of it, especially with memes. They're incredible internet symbols that have the ability to bring people together, function as a source of entertainment, and are able to bring forth people's personal values and beliefs about society. However, I also like to explore the concept of human emotions such as observing what emotions are prominent when giving the eyes and ears different stimuli. </p>
    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">Being able to use video as the main medium for my work allows me to connect with bigger online communities such as YouTube or Reddit. It helps with being able to incorporate multiple memes at the same time to get my feelings or message across since a lot of memes are associated with a particular mood. I'm also able to create soundscapes with video art to create a sort of simulated experience that differs from persont to person. And the added visual effects can give videos a certain aesthetic that can create a particular emotion. </p>
