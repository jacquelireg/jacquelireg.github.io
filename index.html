    <h3 style="color: #F7F4EA">ABOUT THE ARTIST</h3>
    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">I am a digital media artist and works mainly with video art. In this modern day where internet and technology is a major part of people's lives, I like to explore the pop culture aspect of it, especially with memes. They're incredible internet symbols that have the ability to bring people together, function as a source of entertainment, and are able to put forth people's personal values and beliefs about society. However, I also like to explore other subjects that range from visual/audio aesthetics to issues that I've come across in my life to the joys of video games.</p>
