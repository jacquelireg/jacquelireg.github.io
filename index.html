    <h3 style="color: #F7F4EA">ABOUT THE ARTIST</h3>
    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">I am a digital media artist and works mainly with video art. In this modern day where internet and technology is a major part of people's lives, I like to explore the pop culture aspect of it, especially with memes. They're incredible internet symbols that have the ability to bring people together, function as a source of entertainment, and are able to put forth people's personal values and beliefs about society.</p>
    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">Being able to use video as the main medium for my work allows me to connect with bigger online communities such as YouTube or Reddit. It helps with being able to incorporate multiple memes at the same time to get my feelings or message across since a lot of memes are associated with a particular mood. However, I also like to explore other subjects that have affected me throughout my life, whether they be things such as video games or personal issues that I've dealth with, because they've shaped me as a person and hold a place in my heart.</p>
