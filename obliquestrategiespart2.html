"Sick-cute" fashion: a coping mechanism for depressed youth or a dangerous mindset? The trend of accessorizing cute clothing with depictions of gore and medical items feels more like a crutch or temporary relief than a solution.</div>

A looping tribute to one of my favorite video games: BioShock Infinite. People use VHS tapes to look back on fond memories, so I used the same visual style to emulate the nostalgic feeling I experience when re-playing it.</div>

An experimental documentary about how two people view life as college students and how they manage.

This was a weird project for me because I originally had an idea for a video that was more of a scripted short film, but it fell apart when I couldn't coordinate people's schedules to meet up and shoot. I ended up with a a very last minute idea to do something more like a documentary, but didn't have any idea how to shoot it and I had to get it done in one day. It forced me to come up with ideas on the fly, rely on the impromptu reactions of the people I was recording, and figure out how to edit into something comprehensible under a time crunch. I actually enjoyed the process despite all of the hiccups because the end product was something genuine and relatable that didn't require all kinds of planning.
