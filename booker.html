    <p style="color: #F7F4EA">A small, 15 second repeating clip as tribute to one of my favorite games of all time: Bioshock Infinite. I wanted to create something that was visually and audibly jarring. The music is cute and calming, but the clips contrasts this through the clips full of fights, gore and the peril of free falling. It reflects the environment in which Bioshock Infinite takes place because at face value the city of Columbia is seen as heaven on earth, but as the story progresses, it's shown that the city is darker than it appears when it displays issues of racism, classism, and immoral things in the name of religion. I used a VHS effect over it all because it reminded me of home videos and how people use them to look back on memories. This game is a precious memory for me and looking back on it always makes me feel nostalgic. </p>
